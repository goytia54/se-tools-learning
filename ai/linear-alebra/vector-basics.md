# Vector Basics

## Vectors vs Scalar

### Scalar 
* Is just a number
* Weight, temperature, blood pressure
* lower case

### Vector
* Quantity and direction
* lower case bolded roman letters
* List of ordered numbers

### Examples
* Dimensions (number of elements)
* Orientation (column or row)
* column oriented or row oriented
* Length of the vector in python

### Convnetions
* Normal is to have the column be column vector or v
* v^t is a row vector
* tail and head

### Represent in python
* vector as a list
* Numpy arrays
* ([[1,2,3,4]]) column vector
* ([[1],[2],[3],[4]])row vector

## Vector Arithmetic

### Vector Addition
* Can only add things of the same dimension
