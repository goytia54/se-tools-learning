# Machine Learning
* Programming computer to learn new patterns, creating it's own patterns
* Machine can continue to learn

## Arficial Neural Network
* Computer network trying to mimic a human brain
* Like a brain connecting through synapses

### Layers
* Input layer
* Output layer
* Everything inbetween is hidden layer

### Band Example
* Take an sound and then the hidden layers then give
* Hidden layer gives a confidence back with a level
* Pass through the soung enough times, it will know what notes it needs to read it

#### Drawbacks
* Can be time consuming
* They tone the different measures, such as the guitar playing more of the notes
* All the players can change their signals
