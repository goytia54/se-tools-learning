# Finding the Right Approach

## Match Patterns
* Google, would add a weight to a link and thus getting things clicked on with heigher weight and show up with key words
* Might be sensing things humans can't preceive

## Data V Reasoning
* Symbolic = abstract problem but know steps
* Machine learning = look for patterns

### Finding a fan

#### Symbolic Reasoning
* Location
* Manufacture
* No massive amounts of data

#### Deep Learning
* Train machine to recognize fans
* Sensor to detect movement
* Sound of motor or sound
* Zero in on a perfect pattern
* Flexible
* No human reliance

## Supervised/Unsupervised Learning

### Band example
* Catagorize a song into different bins given an input

### Supervised Learning
* Give them a training set, alot of jazz songs (human created)

### Unsupervised Learning
* Give them all the learning and see what catagories they thing, arbituary catagories, not the same (Accurate group things)

## Backprogagation (Only used for supervised learning)
* Lines on the road, deeper groove to follow a trail
* classify one jazz song
* Back prop and will go back to adjust the weight, slight adjustments
* Gradient adjustment, get from black to red in small increments
* Has to identify and help get back on track

## Regression
* Look at relationship between dependent and independent variables

### Lake Example
* DV = Number of people
* IV = Temperature, rain, day of the week

### Credit Card
* DV = likelihood of not paying bills
* IV = items or amounts charged before billing

## Classify (Categories) v Regression (Patterns)
